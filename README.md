# Book Scraper and Viewer
This project contains a Python scraper that collects book data from "http://books.toscrape.com" and a Streamlit application that allows users to view and interact with the scraped data.

# Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv

# Activate the Virtual Environment:
Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py

# Functionality
Scraper: The scraper script (scraper_script.py) visits "http://books.toscrape.com", extracts data about books, and stores it in a database.
Streamlit App: The app.py is a Streamlit application that reads the scraped data from the database and provides a user-friendly interface to filter and view the book data.
# Configuration
Make sure to update the DATABASE_URL in the .env file or set this environment variable appropriately to point to your PostgreSQL database.
Adjust the cron job in the GitHub Actions workflow (/.github/workflows/scraper.yml) if you wish to change the scraping frequency.

# What I Learned
I gained a deeper understanding of:
- Web Scraping
- Data Management
- Application Development

# Questionsï¼š
Everytime I try to link my Supabase database link to the app, I have to debug for an hour to connect it succesfully. I wonder if my connection steps are wrong or is there any code that I can test it out to see if my connection failed or succuess?
